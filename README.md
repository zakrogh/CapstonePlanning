##### Project's Purpose or Goal: Build a website that allows users to register to be notified of snow or other extreme weather conditions in a specific area via SMS (text message).

#### List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:

* Users can register for an account (authentication)
* Information saved in a database
* Users can specify a location (or locations?) they wish to track.
* API calls are made at regular intervals to check weather conditions for each user's location(s)
* SMS messages are sent to users if extreme weather is detected

#### What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.

* C# .NET MVC
* Entity Framework
* OpenWeather API https://openweathermap.org/weather-conditions
* Twilio SMS API https://www.twilio.com/docs/sms/api

#### If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.

* Develop a phone app (iOS or Android) that does not rely on SMS
* Use Google authentication so I don't have to store sensitive user info. https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/web
* Host the project on a live server.
* If hosted online, put Google ads on the page to monetize.

#### What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?

* Building a phone app will require Android studio or Xcode
* Hosting the project will require paying for a web server as well as a paid Twilio account (I intend on using a free developer account for the basic project)
